## Chhana = Paneer = Homemade cheese

If you've ever had saag paneer in an Indian restaurant, you're familiar with the cubes of cheese embedded in spicy spinach slurry. In the state of West Bengal, paneer is called chhana. Same difference. This page will teach you to make chhana.

### What you'll need

```markdown

Implements
A large heavy-bottomed pot with lid
cheesecloth or fine cloth
wooden spoon
colander

Ingredients
gallon of milk (organic whole is best)
quart of buttermilk 

```

### Make the paneer
```markdown
1. Pour the gallon of milk into the pot on the stove.
2. Heat the pot at medium-high heat with the lid mostly on.
   Watch carefully! It can boil fast. If it burns and sticks, the party's over.
3. Once the milk begins to think about boiling, turn the heat to low.
4. Pour in the buttermilk until the milk separates into curds (white solids) and whey (slightly green liquid.)
   Stir until the curds seem to be done separating from the whey, maybe two minutes.
5. Arrange the cheesecloth in the colander so it is both doubled-up and also overlaps the edges
   Set the colander in the sink or over a large bowl to collect the whey.
6. Pour the hot curds and whey from the pot into the cheesecloth-lined colander.
7. Drain the curds
```

## Use the paneer
```markdown
For loose curds, leave in the colander to drain. Eat with sugar or honey.
   
For denser cheese, tie up the ends of the cheesecloth and hang to drip.

For cubes, let drip until dripping stops, spread in a dish to dry out further and cut into cubes.
Fry the cubes before using them in curries to maintain their shape.
